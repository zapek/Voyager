Since there's always something wrong when doing a release, there's a simple
text file which you only have to follow:

IBETA RELEASE
-------------
in config.h, IBETA_RELEASE 1
make alpha

Description:
It will create a v.debug-version that you have to keep to find out enforcer
hits later then mailout automatically to the ibeta mailing-list.


PUBLIC BETA RELEASE
-------------------
in config.h BETA_RELEASE 1
make
make checkdebug

Description:
There's no automatic mailout yet, need to be cleaned up.
