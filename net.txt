Let's follow how V performs a simple download (clicklink + shift)

There are 2 objects:

    - unode: describes an URL can have many nstream clients
    - nstream: describes a connection ("socket") to the server

 nets_open(url, referer, reload, informobj, gauge, txtstatus, addurl);
prepare the message and sends it to the network process (netport)

 nethandler calls upon addstream()

 addstream(unode)
creates a nstream, puts it into into un->clients

(There, nethandler is in a loop which scans every unodes fresly added)

 processunode()
remove all the clients ns->removeme
states:
    UNS_SETUP -> un_setup() -> un_setup_http()
    UNS_LOOKINGUP -> dns
    UNS_WAITINGFORNET -> un_startnet()
    UNS_CONNECTING -> un_doconnect()
    UNS_WAITING -> un_dowaiting()
    UNS_CONNECTED/READING -> un_doprotocol()
    UNS_DONE -> un_done()

and checks if we have to inform un->clients (progress)

--- break ---
Let's follow UNS_CONNECTED

-> un_doprotocol() -> un_doprotocol_http()

 nice loop here :)

un_doprotocol_http_initialreply()
un_doprotocol_http_readheader() (many times)
un_doprotocol_http_afterreadheader() (mime type here)

createdlwin()

un_dowaiting()
un_doprotocol_http_beginreaddata()
un_doprotocol_http_readdata_??() (many times)



I get an Accept-Ranges: bytes btw...


<^o^> nets_close() -> client gone, inform NULL
<^o^> you are making entitiyish assumptions about program flow now :)
<^o^> if this goes like this and that goes like that, case XYZ can't happen
<Zapek> you can nets_close() before going through un_done() ?
<^o^> which normally ends up in an "oops" after a 3 hour debug session 6 month later
<KingGuppy> Impossible to decipher what goes on in it.
<^o^> you can nets_close() anytime
<^o^> user clicks stop -> nets_close() everything etc.
<^o^> I still haven't fixed locutus' porn site thingy
<Zapek> I still don't really understand why there are unodes and nstreams
<^o^> because a unode can have several nstreams as a client
<Zapek> why? isn't an url one stream only ?
<^o^> open the same (large) url in two windows
<^o^> nstream == client structure
<KingGuppy> Or download the same file to two places...
<^o^> unode == actual network object
<^o^> nstream == keeps communication information about one unode and a client
